### handle grid with lots of videos; advice from Rauno

- For each video file, I generate a base64 placeholder which I can use as a loading state
- Only render the videos that are visible on the screen
- As you scroll, this remains trueâ€”videos that go out of the viewport on scroll unmount their video tag. This was the only way to prevent Safari from choking.

### horizontal scrolling

- using Swiper library
  - working (grid, horizontal scrolling, draggable) example: https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/swiper-react-mousewheel-control-forked-hd99tc?file=/src/App.jsx:26,24
    https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/swiper-react-virtual-slides-forked-7mgnqq?file=/src/App.jsx:1,1-100,1
