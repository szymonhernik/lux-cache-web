Here are the key scenarios and considerations for securely managing the integration between your Next.js app, Supabase, Stripe, and Discord:

### 1. **User Subscribes or Changes Subscription Plan**

- **Stripe Webhook Handling**:

  - Ensure you listen for events like `invoice.payment_succeeded`, `customer.subscription.updated`, and `customer.subscription.deleted`.
  - When a subscription is created or changed, update the user's subscription status in Supabase.
  - Update the associated Discord role based on the new subscription level (supporter, subscriber, or premium subscriber).

- **Security**:
  - Validate Stripe webhook payloads using the webhook secret to avoid tampering.
  - Ensure that only valid subscription changes trigger role updates in Discord.

### 2. **User Connects Discord Account**

- **Discord OAuth**:

  - Use OAuth2 to securely connect the user's Discord account. Ensure that sensitive tokens are encrypted when stored.
  - Store the Discord ID, user ID, and connection status in the `discord_integration` table.

- **Security**:
  - Ensure the Discord OAuth2 flow is secure and handles potential vulnerabilities like CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery).
  - Check that a user cannot connect to someone else’s Discord account by validating the user’s identity during the connection process.

### 3. **Updating Discord Roles**

- **Role Assignment**:

  - After the user connects Discord, assign them the appropriate role based on their current subscription.
  - Listen for Stripe webhook events that notify subscription changes and immediately update the corresponding Discord role if the user’s subscription changes (upgraded, downgraded, or canceled).

- **Security**:
  - Ensure that role assignment and updates are triggered only by legitimate subscription status changes.
  - Avoid giving users roles that don't match their current tier by cross-checking Supabase's subscription status before each role update.

### 4. **User Cancels Subscription or Subscription Ends**

- **Role Removal**:

  - If the subscription is canceled or payment fails, remove or downgrade the user's role in Discord based on the updated status from the Stripe webhook.
  - Consider adding a grace period for expired subscriptions before immediately removing roles.

- **Security**:
  - Ensure the user cannot bypass this role removal by manually reconnecting their Discord account after cancellation.

### 5. **Handle Expired or Revoked Discord Tokens**

- **Token Expiration**:

  - Periodically check that the stored Discord tokens remain valid, and prompt the user to reconnect their Discord account if necessary.

- **Revoked Access**:
  - If Discord tokens are revoked or expire, ensure users are prompted to reconnect, and their roles are temporarily removed until they reconnect successfully.

### 6. **Monitoring and Logging**

- **Activity Logs**:

  - Log all key actions such as subscription changes, Discord connections, role assignments, and role removals for auditing and debugging purposes.

- **Error Handling**:
  - In case of failures in webhook processing, Discord API calls, or database updates, have fallback mechanisms to retry the operations or alert the admin.

### 7. **Handling Role Conflicts**

- **Role Prioritization**:
  - If a user has multiple subscriptions (unlikely but possible if subscriptions aren’t canceled properly), ensure you define clear rules for prioritizing roles (e.g., premium supporter > supporter > subscriber).

### 8. **Concurrency and Race Conditions**

- **Webhook and Discord Sync Timing**:
  - Ensure that race conditions are handled where multiple webhooks might trigger Discord role updates simultaneously. For instance, if a user upgrades and then downgrades within seconds, ensure your system processes those changes in the correct order.

### 9. **Graceful Degradation**

- **Discord Downtime**:
  - If Discord’s API is down or unreachable, handle failures gracefully. Queue the role assignment/removal and retry once the service is back online.

### 10. **Regular Syncing**

- **Periodic Role Verification**:
  - Periodically verify that users' roles in Discord match their subscription status in your database. This can help recover from any missed webhook or API issues.
  - Implement a regular task that queries the Stripe subscription status and checks if the user has the correct Discord role.

By considering these scenarios and implementing security best practices, your integration will remain secure, synchronized, and resilient to potential failures.
